# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This guide will get you set up quickly.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-outline.git
cd mcp-outline

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync --group dev

That's it! The pre-commit hooks will automatically format and lint your code on every commit.

uv run ruff format .      # Format code
uv run ruff check .       # Lint code

```
